The most up-to-date Office Hours Schedule:

**UPDATE:** To help you in timely order and be fair to everyone, we are implementing a OH Queue which will provide you a chance to see how many students ahead of you and add your question while you wait. It also helps TA to group students with the same question and helps them faster. **You must enter your name in the queue before enter the waiting room**, and the on-duty TA to call you when it's your turn.

[Office Hour Queue](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xt-MTYbIgXr_WNsWkL87SMuA_ilqhnvQ8llT8rZsJ_4/edit#gid=0){: .btn .btn-primary .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 .mr-2 }
