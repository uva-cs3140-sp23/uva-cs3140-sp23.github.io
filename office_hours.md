To provide more flexibility and accommdation, there will be both in-person and virtual office hours available. Times are subject to change week-to-week, so refer to the calendar below.

UPDATE: TA Office Hours, beginning January 30th, will be on Zoom only at this time until we work out a space for in-person meetings. You can attend the in-person OH with Prof. Nguyen on Tue&Thu 10-11am, Rice 202.
